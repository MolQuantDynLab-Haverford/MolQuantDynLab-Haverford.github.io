## About

Our group is interested in the characterization of molecular systems relevant in atmospheric chemistry. A few topics that have been studied in the past are the spectroscopy, the photodissociation dynamics and the recombination of ozone (O3), the simplest Criegee intermediate (CH2OO) to name a couple in order to understand peculiar phenomena. We are particularly interested in quantifying the Ozone Isotopic Anomaly (MIF of Ozone) which despite experimental observation still suffer a reliable quantitative explanation.
